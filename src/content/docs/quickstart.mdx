Follow this guide to get up and running with the workshop environment in the fastest way possible.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)

Additionally, you'll need a Sentry account to follow along with the tracing and monitoring portions of this workshop:
- [Sign up for a free Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/) if you don't already have an account

:::tip[Pro Tip]
We recommend setting up two separate projects in your Sentry account: one for the frontend (React) and one for the backend (Node.js). This allows you to efficiently monitor each project more clearly. We'll be configuring our SDKs in the workshop, so all you need to do is create the new projects and have your DSN's handy.

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
  1. **Clone the repository**

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-academy-ai-workshop
     ```

  2. **Navigate to the project directory**

     ```bash
     cd sentry-academy-ai-workshop
     ```

  3. **Install dependencies with PNPM**

     ```bash
     pnpm i
     ```

  4. **Set up environment variables**

     ```bash
     touch apps/server/.env
     echo "PORT=3001" >> apps/server/.env
     cd apps/server
     ```

  5. **Database Setup**

     We'll be using [NeonDB](https://neon.new/) for this workshop, so we need to set up the database. Navigate to the `apps/server` directory and run the following commands:

     ```bash
     pnpx neondb
     ```

  7. **Seed the Database**

     ```bash
     pnpm db:generate
     pnpm db:push
     pnpm db:seed
     ```

  8. **Start the Project**

     ```bash
     pnpm dev
     ```

  7. **Access the application project**

     The project will now be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with the backend API running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
</Steps>

## What's Available After Setup

Once you've completed the setup, you'll have access to:

- A Vite-powered React frontend running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- A Node.js backend API running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- Full-stack JavaScript application ready for Sentry instrumentation

This setup will allow you to progress through the workshop and start implementing Sentry. This workshop will take you through setting up **Error Monitoring, Logging, Tracing**, and building visualizations in dashboards!
