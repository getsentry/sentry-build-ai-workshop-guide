## Implementing the Course Creation AI Tool

We already have a basic course creation feature in Sentry Academy, but let's enhance it with better OpenAI function calling and proper Sentry instrumentation.

<Steps>
  1. **Update the Course Creation API with Better Function Calling**

     Navigate to `/apps/server/src/modules/ai/routes.ts` and enhance the existing course creation endpoint with structured function calling:

     ```tsx
     // Add this enhanced function calling definition
     const tools = [
       {
         type: 'function' as const,
         function: {
           name: 'create_structured_course',
           description: 'Create a comprehensive course with detailed modules and lessons',
           parameters: {
             type: 'object',
             properties: {
               title: { 
                 type: 'string', 
                 description: 'Engaging course title that clearly describes the learning outcome' 
               },
               description: { 
                 type: 'string', 
                 description: 'Comprehensive course description explaining what students will learn' 
               },
               category: { 
                 type: 'string', 
                 description: 'Course category (e.g., Programming, Design, Business)' 
               },
               estimatedHours: { 
                 type: 'number', 
                 description: 'Total estimated hours to complete the course' 
               },
               modules: {
                 type: 'array',
                 description: 'Array of course modules',
                 items: {
                   type: 'object',
                   properties: {
                     title: { type: 'string', description: 'Module title' },
                     description: { type: 'string', description: 'Module overview' },
                     lessons: {
                       type: 'array',
                       items: {
                         type: 'object',
                         properties: {
                           title: { type: 'string', description: 'Lesson title' },
                           objectives: { 
                             type: 'array', 
                             items: { type: 'string' },
                             description: 'Learning objectives for this lesson'
                           },
                           estimatedMinutes: { type: 'number', description: 'Estimated completion time' }
                         },
                         required: ['title', 'objectives', 'estimatedMinutes']
                       }
                     }
                   },
                   required: ['title', 'description', 'lessons']
                 }
               }
             },
             required: ['title', 'description', 'category', 'estimatedHours', 'modules']
           }
         }
       }
     ];
     ```

  2. **Add Enhanced Sentry Instrumentation**

     Update the existing course creation function to include better monitoring:

     ```tsx
     // In the same file, update the streamText call to include tools
     const result = await streamText({
       model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
       experimental_telemetry: {
         isEnabled: true,
         functionId: 'generateEnhancedCourse',
         metadata: {
           userPrompt: prompt.substring(0, 100), // First 100 chars for debugging
           requestId: crypto.randomUUID()
         }
       },
       tools,
       toolChoice: 'required',
       messages: [
         {
           role: 'system',
           content: 'You are an expert course creator. Create engaging, well-structured courses that provide clear learning outcomes.'
         },
         {
           role: 'user',
           content: `Create a comprehensive course about: ${prompt}`
         }
       ]
     });
     ```

  3. **Test the Enhanced Course Creation**

     Navigate to the Course Builder in Sentry Academy and create a new course with a prompt like:
     
     "Building scalable REST APIs with Node.js and TypeScript"
